	Have you ever wondered why your dog makes those strange muttering sounds at 
	the dinner table? Or why he lays his ears back when confronted with a stranger?
	Dogs speak to us, but in a different language. Unfortunately, there’s no 
	Rosetta Stone DVD to help us learn “dog talk.” So, instead, we must analyze 
	it ourselves, keeping it in context, avoiding asserting our own interpretations,
	and remembering that dogs were once wild animals.

	The best way to start is to look to the dog’s ancestor, the wolf. Wolves live
	in packs and dogs do the same with other pets in the household and their humans.
	There must be a leader of the pack and that leader should be you. And to be an 
	effective canine leader, you need to know what your dog is trying to tell you.

	Dogs communicate in many ways with each other, using verbal cues, body language 
	and facial expressions. They also try to communicate with humans using these 
	methods. Humans, of course, communicate with dogs with commands and phrases.
	Dogs can learn hundreds of human sounds but they can’t string them together. 
	Thus, the need for short commands such as “Sit!” and “Come!” Many of our 
	communication tools are lost on dogs, such as sarcasm (to indicate frustration)
	or closed body language (to indicate you’re uncomfortable) or a look of surprise.
	So, to enhance our communication with our canines, we must learn to get back to 
	the basics and speak “dog.”
