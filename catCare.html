	Head Butting

	When a ram smashes his skull into another ram, he isn't announcing to the world, 
	“I like you!” But for  cats, a knock of the noggin (referred to as “bunting” or 
	“allorubbing”) is a sign of fondness. “Cats will physically use their heads to 
	show affection,” says Johnson-Bennett, adding that felines may seem to “head butt” 
	you with their foreheads and chins to demonstrate their amorous feelings and to 
	leave their scent as a form of communication and identification.
	
	Blinking

	Cats can also express their affection for you without making physical contact. 
	“Slow, relaxed eye blinks are often referred to as cat kisses,” Johnson-Bennett 
	says. These long blinks indicate Fluffy is happy and relaxed.

	Tail Up

	If your cat greets you with her tail held high, she’s giving you a warm welcome. 
	“A sure sign of happiness is their tail is held upright like a flag pole. Plus, 
	they want to be seen,” says Nagelschneider. Other tip-offs that Kitty is in a good 
	mood: The ears are in a relaxed position, not flattened, and the pupils are 
	normal-sized instead of dilated. Your cat has a relaxed gait when moving about 
	the room and isn’t “skulking around,” says Johnson-Bennett.

	On Its Back

	A cat lying on her back can mean very different things. “It’s important to not 
	take a behavior out of context,” says Nagelschneider. You should look at the cat’s
	body as a whole, including the ears, eyes, paws, and tails. If Snowball is napping
	with her belly exposed, it probably indicates she’s feeling very secure and relaxed. 
	But what if your cat has her tummy showing while she’s awake? If she’s simultaneously 
	purring and kneading her paws in the air, she’s content and stress-free. But if
	she’s on her back with flattened ears or dilated pupils, she feels threatened. Your 
	cat is defensively announcing that if she has to fight, she’s ready to use all of her
	weapons—including those powerful hind legs and claws.
	
	Balling

	If your pet “hunkers down into a tight little ball” and then “tucks his limbs 
	underneath his body and tightly wraps his tail close to his side,” depending on the 
	immediate environment he’s in, he might be indicating that he’s afraid, says 
	Johnson-Bennett. This posture can also mean your cat doesn’t want to be bothered. 
	Essentially, your kitty is trying to make himself as invisible as possible. Balling 
	up usually occurs during times of fear or uncertainty: You might observe this 
	behavior when your cat is at the vet.
